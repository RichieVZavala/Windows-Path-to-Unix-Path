# Windows-Path-to-Unix-Path
I work with Unix systems from a windows device and it's always aggravating have to change the forward and backslashes. I will be updating this repo with a bunch of scripts that I use to make this process easier for me. Things like getting the current directory as Unix. 

# How I run these files
I changed my Python path in Windows to include my repository that hosts these scripts so that I can call them from anywhere using the CMD Prompt. This is the most convenient way for me to do this. 

PowerShell may be able to do some of this stuff but I don't use PowerShell very often. 
If you have an suggestions then please shoot me a message.
